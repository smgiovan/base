For the dataset in train.csv, GBRegressor gets a score of 0.126 (RootMeanSquareLogError, RMSLE)
Used CrossValidation with kfold=3.

Next steps:
  1) Tune model a little more
  2) Run against test.csv and submit results
  
If score applied to test.csv and submitted, the model should get ~1200th place out of ~4800 entries
