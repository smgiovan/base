This kaggle dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques

For the dataset in train.csv (downloaded from kaggle):
  Grid search to tune parameters;  
  CrossValidation with kfold=3;
  Scored model against test data withheld from start

Next steps:
  1) Tune model a little more
  2) Run against test.csv and submit results to kaggle 
  
Current model scores about RMSLE = 0.12
  
If score applied to test.csv and submitted, the model should get ~1200th place out of ~4800 entries
